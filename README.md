expecting performance of testing:
when input is 'US open Thiem' , project will show the attitude bar of the tweets about the keyword.
when input is '@Thiem", project will show the location of the user.
when input is '@1', project will whow in stdout window that some mistake occurs and the explanation of the mistake.
if the testfile does not works well, please run the code file directly to see the performance of three cases.
